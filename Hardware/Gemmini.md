# Gemmini Reviews  
![](../png/GemminiOverview.png)
## Brief Summary  
![](../png/gemminicomp.png)
* Full stack approach  
* co-design  
* evaluation
* a complete SoC integration

Different workers in different layer of machine learning system **hold various expectation on the system.**
## Strengths  
* Both fixed-point representation and floating point representation  
* multiple dataflow
* both vector and systolic spatial array architectures
* direct execution of different DNN
## Weaknesses  

## Improvement  

## Questions  
1. Why use Gemmini to co-design? Especially Virtual address translation system.
2. Why SoC integration with RISC-V arch and things like that matters.
