# MLSys: The New Frontier of Machine Learning Systems
This paper is quite important as it proposes the concept of **Machine Learning System**.   
MLSys focuses on: 
* hardware systems for ML  
* software systems for ML 
* ML optimized for metrics.  

ML framework such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Caffee and so on makes it easier to build state-of-the-art ML models, but systems become the main bottleneck.
